## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Jackets** had the highest number of sales. This shows that they are popular and always in demand, so it’s important to keep them well stocked.
- **Sweaters** sold well in all seasons, meaning they’re a good product to show all year round.
- **Front-of-store placement** resulted in higher average sales, proving that customers are more likely to buy what they see first.  
- **Discounted products** had more sales but made less money per item. This suggests it’s better to be selective with promotions.  
- **Medium-priced** items sold better than expensive ones, indicating hat customers are price-sensitive and prefer more affordable options.

## 📌 Business Recommendations

- Increase visibility of **jackets and sweaters** by placing them at the front of the store or near high-traffic areas.
- Consider **limiting deep discounts** on high-demand items (like jackets) since they sell well even without promotions.
- Promote **shoes and T-shirts** more aggressively to boost their sales volume and reduce inventory.
- Review pricing strategy for **jeans**, as low revenue may suggest limited demand or overpricing.
